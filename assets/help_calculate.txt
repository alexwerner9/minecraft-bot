**Calculating resources**
   - To calculate resources first use the "!calculate"
     command to tell sigma-bot you want to start
     calculating.
     
     After that, use the "!c" command,
     followed by the number of the resource you'd like
     to use, followed by the resource. For example,
     "!c 21 anvil". This will add this resource, and
     calculate out the items needed to craft it. You
     should see a thumbs up by your message if it was
     successful.

     Note that all resources will be one word. If you're
     unsure what the specific name should be, use the
     "!search" command, followed by what you're looking
     for. For example, "!search boat" will give a list
     of the boats you can add ("acacia_boat", "birch_boat",
     etc)

     If the resource you're adding can't be crafted, or you
     already have the items and would just like a full list
     of what you'll need organized in stacks, add the word
     "override" after your command. For example,
     "!c 1139 spruce_planks override". This will tell the
     program to not try to find a crafting recipe for these.

     When you are finished adding items to be calculated,
     use the "!stop" command. This will display
     all of the items you need.
