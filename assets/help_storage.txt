STORING DATA
   - To store data, use the "!store" command, followed by
     the name you'd like to store the data under, followed
     by the data. For example: "!store base 123 11 -24".
     Note that the name used to store the data must be one
     word, but feel free to use underscores (for example,
     "spider_spawner" is fine to use).

     To retrieve this data, use the "!retrieve command",
     followed by the name you stored your data under.

     To see all the names that are stored, uses the
     "!listall" command to list all of the available
     names.
